# Project Status — Facebook Auth Dashboard

> **Maintenance rule (read this first): keep this file current.** Whoever (human or Claude) finishes a meaningful chunk of work on this repo — a shipped PR, a new finding, a change of plan — must update the **"Most recent work"** and **"What's next"** sections below before ending the session. This file is what lets anyone (any device, any fresh Claude session) pick the project up cold. Stale status here is worse than no status at all, so don't skip the update.

## 1. What this is

A Next.js (Pages Router) internal tool for Indian D2C Facebook/Meta Ads media buying. Lets a user log in with Facebook and: audit an ad account, get a recommended campaign strategy, launch campaigns/ad sets directly, investigate recent account changes, and build arbitrary custom report views ("Explore").

- **Repo:** `architmittal00/ads-studio-onboarding` (GitHub)
- **App subdirectory:** `facebook-auth-dashboard/` (this file's directory) — the git root one level up (`/Users/architmittal/Documents/Studio Onboarding Archit`) also contains unrelated personal/other-project files (dark-theme, Admin design, scene-detector, etc.) that have nothing to do with this app.
- **Deployed:** https://ads-studio-onboarding.vercel.app (Vercel, auto-deploys from `main`)
- **Architecture / how-it-works reference:** [`README.md`](./README.md) in this same directory — it's long and kept detailed and up to date per-feature. **Read it** for how any given feature actually works, Graph API caveats, caching layers, env vars, etc. This status file is deliberately *not* a duplicate of that — it's the "where are we, what's next" layer on top.

## 2. How to work on this repo (read before touching code)

1. **Always fetch before trusting local git state.** See §3 below — the primary checkout can be badly stale. Run `git fetch origin` and diff against `origin/main`, don't trust a local branch pointer.
2. **Never commit directly to `main`.** Every change ships via a feature branch + PR, created from a **fresh worktree off a freshly-fetched `origin/main`** — not from whatever the primary checkout's working directory currently has lying around in it. Pattern used throughout this project's history:
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/architmittal/Documents/Studio Onboarding Archit/facebook-auth-dashboard"
   git fetch origin
   git worktree add .worktrees/<short-name> -b <branch-name> origin/main
   cd .worktrees/<short-name>/facebook-auth-dashboard
   # make the change, npm install, npm run lint, npm run build
   git add <specific files>   # never blanket `git add -A` in this repo
   git commit -m "..."
   git push -u origin <branch-name>
   gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."
   gh pr merge <N> --squash --delete-branch
   cd "/Users/architmittal/Documents/Studio Onboarding Archit/facebook-auth-dashboard"
   git worktree remove .worktrees/<short-name> --force
   ```
3. **Standing authorization:** the user (archit.mittal@pickrr.com) has explicitly and repeatedly authorized pushing and merging to GitHub without asking for confirmation each time. Still use feature branches + PRs (never push straight to `main`), but don't pause to ask before merging.
4. **Always `npm run lint && npm run build`** in the worktree before shipping. Both must be clean.
5. **Browser-verify before shipping**, using the disposable mocked-preview-harness convention (see §5) — don't ship UI changes on lint/build passing alone.
6. **One commit per logically-complete PR**, squash-merged. Keep PRs scoped (a batch of related small fixes in one PR is fine and is the established pattern here — see PR #135, #140 for examples of 5-7 related items shipped together).

## 3. ⚠️ Known trap: the primary checkout is unreliable

`/Users/architmittal/Documents/Studio Onboarding Archit/facebook-auth-dashboard` (no `.worktrees/*` suffix — the directory this file lives in) is **not a reliable source of truth**. Its checked-out branch has, more than once, been found to be 50-180+ commits behind `origin/main` while its *working tree* still had a pile of large uncommitted `M`/`??` changes sitting in it — not real local work, just stale drift from old sessions that used this checkout for live dev-server preview testing without ever committing/pulling here.

**Concretely, as of 2026-10-13:** this checkout is on branch `feat/mof-retargeting-engagers`, whose tip commit (`d19df7d`) was merged into `main` ~140 commits ago — the branch itself is long obsolete. The working tree nonetheless has dozens of files showing as modified/untracked (`pages/explore.js`, `pages/launch.js`, `components/SortableTable.js`, etc.) purely because they mirror already-shipped `origin/main` content sitting uncommitted on disk. **Do not `git add`/commit from this checkout directly, and do not assume its `git diff` represents real pending work.**

**How to work safely here:**
- Before concluding anything is "uncommitted work that needs shipping," run `git fetch origin` then diff the specific file against the real blob: `diff <(git show origin/main:facebook-auth-dashboard/<path>) <path>`. If they match, it's just stale drift — ignore it.
- When something *does* turn out to be real new work sitting in this checkout (rare, but happened with the Explore "Part 3" batch — see §5), extract it by diffing against `origin/main`, confirm the diff is scoped to what you expect, then copy just those files into a fresh worktree branched off `origin/main` and ship from there. Full worked example: PR #140 (this session) and PR #77 (earlier).
- This checkout is also what `preview_start`'s dev server convention points at in `.claude/launch.json` (port 3000) — if you need to browser-test a worktree's code instead, run `npm run dev` manually on a different port inside the worktree and open it via `preview_start` with an explicit `url` (see §5).
- **Possible future cleanup** (not yet done, needs user confirmation since it's a bit destructive): this checkout could be reset to track `main` properly (`git checkout main && git pull`) and have its stale working-tree cruft reconciled or discarded. Nobody has done this yet — raise it with the user before doing it, since there could in principle be real uncommitted work buried in there that hasn't been triaged.

## 5. Most recent work (2026-10-14)

### PR #161 — Fix date range popover rendering behind the tab strip

The `DateRangeMenu` popover (`position: fixed; z-index: 50`) was still confined to the stacking context of its own sticky wrapper row (`z-index: 4`) — a sticky element with an explicit z-index creates a stacking context, and nothing inside it can out-rank a *sibling* stacking context no matter its own z-index, so the tab strip's sticky wrapper (`z-index: 5`) rendered on top of the entire popover. Most visible when the popover had to flip above its trigger (not enough room below) — the tab strip then visibly overlapped the calendar. Fixed by rendering the popover through `createPortal` to `document.body`, escaping any ancestor's stacking context entirely — the general fix for this class of bug, not just this one instance of it.

### PR #159 — Fix date range Update, theme its calendar/compare controls, stop defaulting duplicate destinations

Follow-up feedback on #155 and #157: (1) `DateRangeMenu`'s "Update" button only patched the view's query spec, it never actually re-ran the query — the table kept showing stale data no matter what you picked. Now it re-runs the active query immediately (when the view is otherwise runnable), matching Meta's own picker. (2) The "Compare to previous period" → "Custom start date" field was a bare native `<input type="date">`, popping the OS's own unstyled calendar — replaced with a themed single-month picker reusing the same `Month` component as the main range calendar. (3) "Compare to previous period" is now a toggle switch, not a checkbox, consistent with the rest of the popover. (4) `DuplicateEntityModal` no longer defaults the destination to wherever the source already lives (the "default + Change escape hatch" design #157 shipped) — every duplicate path now starts unresolved ("Not selected yet") and requires an explicit pick; duplicating an ad cascades "choose a destination campaign" → "choose a destination ad set" scoped to that campaign, duplicating an ad set requires explicitly choosing a destination campaign. No backend/endpoint changes.

### Earlier rounds (compressed)

- **PR #157 / #154–155**: Explore's "Duplicate" row action moved from navigating to `/launch` into an in-place `DuplicateEntityModal` popup (`pages/launch.js`'s now-dead `?duplicateAdId=`/`?duplicateAdsetId=` hand-off removed; its own standalone "Duplicate an Ad Set" entry card is unchanged). A collapsed tab group used to still show its active member tab (fixed to hide every member when collapsed, matching Chrome), the same grouping feature was ported to Recent Changes, and date range + "Compare to previous period" moved out of Explore's collapsible Query panel into the `DateRangeMenu` control (later revised by #159/#161 above).
- **PR #152**: Explore's RowActions gained `Duplicate` on ad/ad-set rows. Duplicating an ad points the new ad at the same creative by id (so a partnership/branded-content ad duplicates correctly for free); duplicating an ad set carries over all of its own ads the same way. Both always create paused.
- **PR #148–150**: "Monthly" time-grouping, a "% Change / Absolute value" comparison toggle, a real Level+"Group by time" pivot table (per-entity aggregation had to move server-side — several metrics' `aggregate()` functions read Facebook's *raw* field names that never reach the client); per-tab persistence of the results table's own sort/search/column-order/frozen-column state; the original Chrome-style tab groups feature.
- **PR #140–146**: column-order reconciliation on re-query, frozen-column/sticky-header z-index and chart `connectNulls` fixes, clickable campaign/ad-set names for expand/collapse, and the Total row rebuilt as a genuinely separate always-visible table.

**Testing-environment gotchas** (still relevant): neither a programmatic `el.scrollTop = n` on `document.body` nor a `resize_window` viewport change reliably fires a native `scroll`/`resize` DOM event in the Browser-tool pane — a CDP-automation quirk, not this app; scroll a plain (non-`body`) element instead. An automated `key: "Enter"` sent in the same batch right after a `type` action can race ahead of React's controlled-input state update — retry with the Enter/blur as its own separate tool call before assuming a commit-on-Enter handler is actually broken. A page gated by `getServerSideProps` (every real route in this app) can't be reached via normal client-side navigation from inside a mocked preview — test each gated page's flow via its *own* dedicated preview wrapper instead of clicking through from one preview into another page. The Browser tool's `left_click` on a ref sometimes auto-scrolls the target into view first, and if that scroll lands on something outside a popover with a capture-phase "close on scroll" listener, the popover closes before the click itself registers — reads exactly like "clicking this button silently does nothing," but verifying via `javascript_tool`'s direct `element.click()` (no scrolling involved) confirms whether the app logic itself is actually fine before assuming it's broken.

All rounds verified via a disposable mocked preview harness (deleted before commit — see the convention note below); `npm run lint` and `npm run build` clean for all.

### The mocked-preview-harness convention (use this for any Explore UI verification)

Create a throwaway page like `pages/explore-<name>-preview.js` that:
```jsx
import { SessionProvider } from "next-auth/react";
import { AccountProvider } from "@/components/AccountProvider";
import Explore from "./explore"; // or whatever real page you're testing

const FAKE_SESSION = { user: { name: "Test User" }, expires: "2099-01-01T00:00:00.000Z" };

if (typeof window !== "undefined" && !window.__xPreviewMocked) {
  window.__xPreviewMocked = true;
  const realFetch = window.fetch.bind(window);
  window.fetch = (url, opts) => {
    // intercept /api/fb/data, /api/fb/custom-conversions, /api/fb/explore-insights
    // with hand-built fake JSON responses, fall back to realFetch otherwise
  };
}

export default function Preview() {
  return (
    <SessionProvider session={FAKE_SESSION}>
      <AccountProvider><Explore /></AccountProvider>
    </SessionProvider>
  );
}
```
Run it via a `npm run dev` on a throwaway port (e.g. `PORT=3101 npm run dev` inside the worktree, backgrounded) and open it in the Browser tool with `preview_start({ url: "http://localhost:3101/explore-<name>-preview" })`. **Delete the preview file before committing** — it must never ship.

**Caveat:** localStorage (views, cached query results) persists across different preview pages on the same origin (`localhost:<port>`) — a stale cached result can carry over between test runs. Use the app's own "Hard Refresh" button (bypasses the cache lookup) rather than "Update This View" when you need to guarantee a fresh fetch against your mock.

**Caveat:** a fresh `npm install && npm run build` in a brand-new worktree has occasionally failed once with a `next/font/google` module-not-found error — a known transient issue, fixed by `rm -rf .next && npm run build` retry, not a real code problem.

## 6. Stale plans — do not redo this work

Two plan-mode files have been found, at different times, sitting on disk as if still "pending," when the work they describe was actually already fully implemented and merged. **Before acting on any `.claude/plans/*.md` file found on disk for this project, check `git log origin/main` for whether it's already done.**

- `optimized-pondering-avalanche.md` ("Launch tab: direct campaign + ad set creation for Indian D2C") — **already fully implemented**, merged via PR #124 (`33edfd9`, "Add Launch tab...") and polished further in #125/#126. `/launch` exists and works on `origin/main` today. Confirmed 2026-10-13.
- An earlier plan about funnel metrics / custom metrics / multi-account Explore was likewise found already merged (PRs #67–#75), per an earlier session's note.

If a plan file resurfaces again claiming to be the active plan, always verify against `git log origin/main -- <relevant path>` before treating it as real pending work.

## 7. What's next

**Nothing is currently queued.** Every batch of user-requested Explore fixes in §5 is fully shipped. There is no known open task, bug, or plan waiting to be picked up as of 2026-10-14.

When new work comes in:
1. Read this whole file first, then skim `README.md` for the relevant feature area.
2. `git fetch origin` and work from a fresh worktree off `origin/main` (§2, §3) — don't trust the primary checkout's working tree.
3. Check `gh pr list --state open` in case something was left mid-flight by another session/device since this file was last updated.
4. After shipping, **come back and update this file**: move what you just did into §5 (replacing or appending to the "most recent work" narrative — keep roughly the last 1-2 rounds of detail, it's fine to compress or drop older entries once they're thoroughly reflected in merged PRs and README.md), and reset this section to reflect the real next state (either "nothing queued" again, or whatever's left).
